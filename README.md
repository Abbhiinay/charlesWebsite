# Responsive Website
Author: Abbhiinay
<br>
This website is basically of a web developer who provides his services such as Web designing , that may be Front-end or Back-end .
<br>
I made this website responsively so that it can be viewed on any devices, from mobile to Laptop.
<br>
The website consists of a navigation bar, that contains all the sections that are available in the webpage. once the user clicks any link on nav bar, that particular section will be shown on screen.
<br>
I used flex and grid properties for a good layout in particular sections.
<br>
I have also added a simple footer that contains details or links related to author and also logo, copyrights of the website.
